## Introduction

The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) [@lovelace2017propensity] offers an 
intuitive way to understand where and to what extent residents of the UK 
utilize cycling as a mode of transit for their daily work commute. Our project 
aims to replicate and extend the work of the PCT in the city of Pittsburgh.
